Alfresco Two-Factor Authentication Extension
============================================

Author: Simon Buckle
Email: simon@webteq.eu

This is an extension for Alfresco that implements two-factor authentication using a YubiKey.

Configuration
-------------

By default, Yubico's validation servers are used to validate the OTPs generated by the key. As such, you will need to get an API key (https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/). Once you have signed up, you will need to update the 'YubicoClient' bean definition in the configuration file (verification-service-context.xml) with the client id and (optionally) the key.

If you are using your own validation servers then the default validation server URLs will also need to be changed.

By default, login (using a key) via Share is disabled. To enable it, uncomment the bean definitions in alfresco/extension/custom-web-context.xml.

Installation
------------

This extension has been tested against Alfresco 3.4.
Copy alfresco.war to the root directory of the extension and run:  ant integrate-extension

The alternative is to run: ant package-extension, which will produce a zip file. To deploy it, extract the contents of the zip file to the root directory of the deployed Alfresco instance.

Note
----

This extension comes bundled with a pre-built version of the Yubico Java client.

This is a customised build of the client that can be found here:

The code is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

Support
-------

Keys can be reprogrammed if you want to host your own validation servers. If you want some help with this or to discuss the available options, then feel free to send me an email.
